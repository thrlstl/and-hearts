## About this Application

What is it? — Animated 'like' button and notification with React Hooks, CSS and Javascript.

I created this educational React application in conjunction with my [blog](http://omdbapi.com/ "Blog") published in The Startup - CSS Animations with React Hooks. Together, they demonstrate how to animate an application with cleaner state changes and attribute selectors.
