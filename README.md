## About this Application

What is it? — Animated 'like' button and notification with React Hooks, CSS and Javascript.

I created this educational React application in conjunction with my [blog](https://medium.com/swlh/css-animations-with-react-hooks-1d855dab4a3 "Blog") published in The Startup - CSS Animations with React Hooks. Together, they demonstrate how to animate an application with cleaner state changes and attribute selectors.
